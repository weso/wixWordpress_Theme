It covers 81 countries, incorporating indicators that assess the areas of universal access; freedom and openness; relevant content; and empowerment. <a href=javascript:void(0) class=read-more>Read More <span>&rsaquo;</span></a></p> <p class=author>by <a href="" rel=author>Gabe Trodd</a></p> <hr> </article> <article class=text-article id=methodology> <p class=chapter>3</p> <h1>Methodology</h1> <p>The Web Index is a composite measure that summarizes in a single (average) number the impact and value derived from the Web in various countries. There are serious challenges when attempting to measure and quantify some of the dimensions the Index covers (e.g. the social and political), and suitable proxies are used instead.</p> <p>Also, as the Web Index covers a large number of countries, some of which have serious data deficiencies or were not covered by the data providers, we needed to impute the missing data. We worked with eminent experts in the relevant fields to overcome these challenges and produce a robust and rigorous Index.</p> <p>Two types of data were used in the construction of the Index: existing data from other data providers (“secondary data”), and new data gathered via a multi-country questionnaire (“primary data”) that was specifically designed by the Web Foundation and its advisers. These primary data will begin to fill in some of the gaps in measurement of the utility and impact of the Web in various countries. Indeed, the data gaps in this field are significant, and we aim to expand those questionnaires in future editions of the Index, both in terms of the questions/indicators gathered and the number of countries covered by the Index.</p> <h3>Index Computation</h3> <p>There has been no change from 2012's Index in the statistical approach used for the computation of the Web Index. There are several steps in the process of constructing a composite Index. Some of those involve deciding which statistical method to use in the normalisation and aggregation processes. In arriving at that decision, we took into account several factors, including the purpose of the Index, the number of dimensions we were aggregating, and the ease of disseminating and communicating it, in an understandable, replicable and transparent way. The following 10 steps summarise the computation process of the Index:</p> <ol> <li>Take the data for each indicator from the data source for the 81 countries covered by the Index for the 2007-2012 time period (or 2013, in the case of the Web Index expert assessment survey).</li> <li>Impute missing data for every secondary indicator for the sample of 81 countries over the period 2007-2012. Some indicators were not imputed as it was not logical to do so. None of the primary data indicators were imputed. Hence the 2013 Index is very different from the 2007-2012 Indexes that were computed using secondary data only. Broadly, the imputation of missing data was done using two methods: country-mean substitution if the missing number is in the middle year (e.g. have 2008 and 2010 but not 2009), or taking arithmetic growth rates on a year-by-year basis. Most missing data for 2011 and 2012 are imputed by applying the arithmetic growth rate for the period, to the 2010 number. For the indicators that did not cover a particular country in any of the years, no imputation was done for that country/indicator.</li> <li>Normalise the full (imputed) dataset using z-scores, making sure that for all indicators, a high value is “good” and a low value is “bad”.</li> <li>Cluster some of the variables (as per the scheme in the tree diagram), taking the average of the clustered indicators post normalisation. For the clustered indicators, this clustered value is the one to be used in the computation of the Index components.</li> <li>Compute the nine component scores using arithmetic means, using the clustered values where relevant.</li> <li>Compute the min-max values for each z-score value of the components, as this is what will be shown in the visualisation tool and other publications containing the component values (generally, it is easier to understand a min-max number in the range of 0 - 100 rather than a standard deviation-based number). The formula for this is : [(x - min)/(max - min)]*100.</li> <li>Compute sub-index scores by calculating the weighted averages the z-scores of the relevant components for each sub-Index.</li> <li>Compute the min-max values for each z-score value of the sub-Indexes, as this is what will be shown in the visualization tool and other publications containing the sub-index values.</li> <li>Compute overall composite scores by calculating the weighted average of the sub-indexes.</li> <li>Compute the min-max values (on a scale of 0-100) for each z-score value of the overall composite scores, as this is what will be shown in the visualisation tool and other publications containing the composite scores.</li> </ol> <h3>Indicator Inclusion Criteria</h3> <p>We searched a large number of international databases to find indicators that measure or proxy the dimensions under study.</p> <p>Before an indicator is included in the Index, it needs to fulfill five basic criteria:</p> <ol> <li>Data providers have to be credible and reliable organisations, that are likely to continue to produce data for the same indicators (e.g. theirs is not a once-off dataset being published).</li> <li>Data releases should be regular, with new data released at least every three years.</li> <li>There should be at least two data years for each indicator, so that basic statistical inference could be made.</li> <li>The latest data year should be no older than three years prior to publication year. For example, if the first Index is published in 2012, data must be available, at a minimum, for 2009 and before.</li> <li>The data source should cover at least two-thirds of the sample of countries, so that possible bias - introduced by having a large number of indicators from one source that systematically does not cover one-third or more of the countries - is reduced.</li> </ol> <h3>Acknowledgments</h3> <p>The Web Index benefited from the help and advice of many people, and involved a rigorous process of collecting and analyzing data across a large number of indicators and countries, as well as consulting leading experts in various fields.</p> <p>The Web Index Science Council continues to provide valuable advice in the construction and analysis of the Web Index. The Science Council members are: Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Ackland, Paola Annoni, Renata Avila, Kilnam Chon, Anriette Esterhuysen, Eszter Hargittai, William Lehr, Michele Luzi, Beth Noveck, Nii Quaynor, Taylor Reynolds, and Piotr Strysczowski. We are grateful for their generous contribution of their time and expertise (please refer to the Web Foundation - Web Index Website for more details on the Science Council).</p> <p>The Web Index benefited from patient and efficient production partners: Dr Raul Katz of Telecom Advisory Services and Dr Pantelis Koutroumpis, Research Fellow at Imperial College Business School, who assisted with the production and computation of the Index; Nathaniel Heller, Hazel Feigenblatt and Monika Shepard at Global Integrity, who managed the primary research via their Indaba platform; the European Commission's Joint Research Centre, Unit of Econometrics and Applied Statistics-Ispra - IT who supported us on methodological and statistical analysis; Jose María Alvarez Rodríguez and Jose E. Labra of WESO for data work; Iconomical for web design and Miska Knapek for graphic design.</p> <p>Special thanks to Gus Hossein, Sam Smith, and Carly Nyst at Privacy International and to Michel van Eeten, Mark Klamberg, Roger Clark, and Volker Tripp for their assistance in deciphering the complexities of privacy law. We are also grateful to UN Women for their input on the design of gender-related questions. However, any errors are the sole responsibility of the Web Foundation.</p> <p>The following institutions have very generously allowed us to use and re-publish their data, and for that we are grateful: Alexa, Ethnologue, the Economist Intelligence Unit, Euromonitor, Freedom House, Facebook, INSEAD, Cornell University, World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) International Energy Agency, Reporters Without Borders, the UN Public Administration Network, the ITU, Wikimedia Foundation, GSMA Intelligence, the CIA Factbook, the World Bank, and the World Economic Forum, please click here or refer to the data provider's website.</p> <p>The Web Index research was managed by Karin Alexander and directed by Dr. Hania Farhan, with support from Jules Clement, Anne Jellema, José M. Alonso, Tim Davies, Sonia Jorge, Dillon Mann, Gabe Trodd, Aman Grewal, Sofia Latif and the rest of the Web Foundation team. The team is grateful to the large number of experts and professionals who assisted us with the Expert Assessment survey.</p> <p>Finally, particular thanks must go to UK Aid for funding the continued development and production of the Web Index and to Bain and Company for significant in-kind support.</p> <h3>Expert Assessment Survey</h3> <p>Following the same methodology applied in 2012, and after refining the structure of the 2013 Web Index, the next step was to populate the nine components of the Index with additional and new indicators that would capture each concept and each dimension sufficiently well. The search for secondary indicators was extensive and covered a large number of reliable and credible organisations that gather data in the field (such as ITU, UN, World Bank, WEF, etc.). However, as with last year's Index, in some dimensions there were only few indicators that fit the criteria set for indicator inclusion for all the components (see the methodology section of the Web Index Report 2013).</p> <p>The process for collecting new primary data involved an ‘evidence-driven' expert assessment survey. The questionnaire was carefully refined in consultation with various experts in different fields, and a group of multi-disciplinary experts and professionals were selected in each of the 81 countries to score the questionnaires. The scorers were required to conduct desk research and interviews with key informants to score precisely defined questions, and to substantiate those scores with robust narrative comments and references (such as an academic article, media reports, laws, etc.), to reduce the degree of subjectivity. The 81 scorers were complemented with peer reviewers for each country (the scorer and the peer reviewer did their work independently of each other), in order to validate or otherwise question and improve the scorers results. A group of technical reviewers and regional reviewers also examined the scores for each question/indicator. A final level of checking and validation was conducted by the project team.</p> <p>Global Integrity's web-based platform (www.getindaba.org) was used to implement the survey in all the countries.</p> <h4>Acknowledgments</h4> <p>Special thanks and recognition goes to the Global Integrity team for their patient and committed work on this project.</p> <p>The World Wide Web Foundation would also like to thank the following participants, who were instrumental in fulfilling and completing the expert assessment surveys for the Web Index.
